## Project Overview

This project involved the comprehensive structural design and urban planning for a 15-story residential complex located in Alexandria, Egypt. The development consists of 180 residential units across three towers, designed to accommodate modern living standards while maintaining structural integrity in coastal conditions.

## Key Engineering Challenges

### Structural Design
- **Foundation System**: Deep pile foundation design to handle the coastal soil conditions and high groundwater table
- **Seismic Considerations**: Implementation of seismic-resistant design principles according to Egyptian building codes
- **Wind Load Analysis**: Comprehensive wind load calculations for coastal exposure conditions

### Planning & Design Features
- **Space Optimization**: Efficient floor plan layouts maximizing living space while maintaining structural efficiency
- **Sustainability**: Integration of energy-efficient systems and sustainable construction materials
- **Accessibility**: Full compliance with accessibility standards including ramps, elevators, and barrier-free design

## Technical Specifications

- **Total Built Area**: 25,000 mÂ²
- **Building Height**: 45 meters
- **Foundation Type**: Reinforced concrete piles with pile caps
- **Structural System**: Reinforced concrete frame with shear walls
- **Construction Duration**: 24 months

## Engineering Solutions

The project required innovative solutions for the challenging coastal environment:

1. **Corrosion Protection**: Special concrete mix design with additives to resist chloride penetration
2. **Thermal Comfort**: Optimized building orientation and facade design for energy efficiency
3. **Infrastructure Integration**: Coordination with municipal utilities and transportation networks

## Project Outcome

The residential complex was successfully completed on schedule and within budget, providing high-quality housing units while setting new standards for coastal construction in the region. The project has received recognition for its innovative engineering solutions and sustainable design approach.

## My Role

As the lead structural engineer, I was responsible for:
- Complete structural analysis and design
- Coordination with architectural and MEP teams
- Supervision of construction documentation
- Quality control during construction phases
- Compliance with local building codes and regulations
